class QHBM(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  r"""Methods for inference involving normalized exponentials of Hamiltonians.

  We also call the normalized exponential of a Hamiltonian a "thermal state".
  Here we formalize some aspects of thermal states, which will be used later
  to explain particular methods of this class.

  # TODO(#119): add reference to updated QHBM paper.

  Each method takes as input some modular Hamiltonian
  $$K_{\theta\phi} = U_\phi K_\theta U_\phi^\dagger.$$
  The [thermal state][1] corresponding to the model is
  $$ \rho_T = Z^{-1} e^{-\beta K_{\theta\phi}}.$$
  For QHBMs, we assume $\beta = 1$, effectively absorbing it into the definition
  of the modular Hamiltonian.  Then $\rho_T$ can be expanded as
  $$\rho_T = \sum_x p_\theta(x)U_\phi\ket{x}\bra{x}U_\phi^\dagger,$$
  where the probability is given by
  $$p_\theta(x) = \tr[\exp(-K_\theta)]\bra{x}\exp(-K_\theta)\ket{x}$$
  for $x\in\{1, \ldots, \dim(K_{\theta\phi})\} = \mathcal{X}$. Note that each
  $U_\phi\ket{x}$ is an eigenvector of both $\rho_T$ and $K_{\theta\phi}$.

  Corresponding to this density operator is an [ensemble of quantum states][2].
  Using the terms above, we define the particular ensemble
  $$\mathcal{E} = \{p_\theta(x), U_\phi\ket{x}\}_{x\in\mathcal{X}},$$
  also known as the [canonical ensemble][2] corresponding to $\rho_T$.
  Each method of this class implicitly samples from this ensemble, then
  post-processes to perform a particular inference task.

    Here we explain the algorithm.  First, construct $X$ to be a classical
    random variable with probability distribution $p_\theta(x)$ set by
    `model.energy`.  Then, draw $n = $`num\_samples` bitstrings,
    $S=\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$, from $X$.  For each unique $x_i\in S$, set
    `states[i]` to the TFQ string representation of $U_\phi\ket{x_i}$, where
    $U_\phi$ is set by `model.circuit`.  Finally, set `counts[i]` equal to the
    number of times $x_i$ occurs in $S$.

    Args:
      model: The modular Hamiltonian whose normalized exponential is the
        density operator governing the ensemble of states from which to sample.
      num_samples: Number of states to draw from the ensemble.

      states: 1D `tf.Tensor` of dtype `tf.string`.  Each entry is a TFQ string
        representation of an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian `model`.
      counts: 1D `tf.Tensor` of dtype `tf.int32`.  `counts[i]` is the number of
        times `states[i]` was drawn from the ensemble.
